# Youthscores backend

Flask + SQLAlchemy API and admin panel for the Egyptian youth competition system.
Schema follows `../readme.txt`, with the deviations listed below.

## Local setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
flask db upgrade              # builds the schema on SQLite
```

`FLASK_APP=wsgi.py` is needed for the `flask` commands.

## PythonAnywhere

Create the MySQL database from the **Databases** tab, then confirm its charset —
**Arabic text silently corrupts on `latin1` or `utf8`**, and the tables inherit
whatever the database defaults to:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE `USER$youthscores`
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example`, keep `?charset=utf8mb4`) and run
`flask db upgrade`. The custom domain **youthscores.org** requires a paid plan;
free accounts only get `*.pythonanywhere.com`.

## Schema notes

24 tables: the design doc's 18, plus six the app needs.

### Added beyond the design doc

| Addition | Why |
|---|---|
| `venues`, `news`, `ads`, `app_versions` | The current JSON feed serves all four and each has a screen in the apps. The doc covers none of them. |
| `group_teams` | The doc links groups to matches only, so a team that has not played yet could not appear in its own standings table, and a team progressing to a later stage had nowhere to record its second group. |
| `competition_teams` | The competition roster. 11 of 28 imported competitions run without groups, so group membership cannot stand in for "who is entered". |
| `competitions.code` + `sector_*` | The feed nests competition → age → sector; each sector is its own competition instance, tied to its siblings by `code`. |
| `admin_users` | The doc never says who may enter data. |
| `teams.point_deduction` | Feeds the points column in the standings; the feed carries it. |
| `matches.week` | The fixtures list groups by matchday. |
| `matches.note_en/ar` | Present in the feed. |
| `players.birth_year_verified` | See below. |

### Changed from the design doc

- **`matches.status`** is `scheduled/live/completed/postponed/cancelled`, not
  `scheduled/played/postponed`. `completed` is what the feed and both clients
  already use, and `live` is needed for in-progress scores.
- **`minute` is nullable** on goals, cards and substitutions. The doc has it NOT
  NULL, but the JSON being migrated records only scorer names and counts — never
  minutes — so every historical row would fail the constraint.
- **`players.birth_year`** stays NOT NULL, but migrated players have no birth
  year in the source. It is inferred from the age group of the team they played
  for and flagged `birth_year_verified = FALSE`. That guess is wrong for anyone
  playing up, which is exactly what the flag is for:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM players WHERE birth_year_verified = 0;
  ```
- Tables are **plural** (`matches`, `competition_groups`). `MATCH` and `GROUP`
  are reserved words in MySQL.
- **`Team` is no longer unique on `(club, age_group, season)`.** A club can enter
  the same competition twice for separate phases, and the two must stay separate
  or the standings double-count. Identity moved to `Team.source_ref`.

### Standings

Computed in Python (`app/services/standings.py`), replacing the identical Dart
and TypeScript copies. Rules: completed non-knockout matches only, 3/1/0 points
starting from `-point_deduction`, sorted by points, ties broken within each
level.

The tiebreak is a real competition rule, kept verbatim: head-to-head is used
**only when every tied pair has played exactly twice**, otherwise it falls back
to overall goal difference then goals scored. Pinned down in
`tests/test_standings.py`.

Verified by running the shipping `web/src/lib/utils.ts` (unmodified — Node 24
strips the types) against this Python over all 4,459 imported matches: **48 of 48
group tables identical** in order, points and goal difference.

A team is **one competition entry, not one club.** A club that re-enters a
competition for a second phase is two feed entries with their own tables and
points; merging them by name piled both phases onto one row and inflated the
standings. `Team.source_ref` keeps them apart; they share a `Club`. This is why
there are 470 teams for 178 clubs.

### Rules encoded in the schema

- **Age eligibility** — `age_groups.oldest_birth_year` is the earliest birth year
  allowed. `player.birth_year >= oldest_birth_year`, so younger players may play
  up but older players can never play down. `AgeGroup.allows()` in
  `app/models/core.py`.
- **One club, every age group** — one `clubs` row, one `teams` row per age group
  per season, unique on `(club_id, age_group_id, season_id)`.
- **Transfers** — `player_teams` rows with `end_date = NULL` meaning current.
  A mid-season move closes the old row and opens a new one.
- **Goals follow the club, not the player** — `match_goals.team_id` records who
  the goal was scored *for*, so a transferred player's goals stay with the old
  club while his profile follows him. Own goals set `team_id` to the benefiting
  team and `scorer_id` to the player who scored it, so top-scorer queries must
  exclude `is_own_goal`.

## Importing the legacy JSON

```bash
python -m scripts.migrate_json           # re-runnable; adds nothing on a second run
python -m scripts.migrate_json --reset   # wipe the season and re-import
python -m scripts.migrate_json --report  # describe the imported data
```

Imports the **2025-2026** season only. The feed also carries a 2026-2027 season
(c007–c011, teams but almost no matches yet); pass `--season 2026-2027` for it.

Current result: 4,459 matches, 178 clubs, 440 teams, 3,414 players, 7,013 goals —
reconciled against the source feed exactly.

### How the feed maps onto the schema

The feed nests **competition → age → sector**, where a sector (Cairo / Delta /
Upper Egypt) has its own teams, matches and table. Each sector is therefore its
own `competitions` row, tied back to its siblings by `code`.

Two different things are both called "group" in the feed:

| Feed field | Meaning | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `team.group` | The team's group — `الاوائل`, `2A` | `competition_groups` + `group_teams`; what standings group by |
| `match.group` | A phase label — `المرحلة الاولي` | `matches.round_label_ar`, and `group_id` too when it names a real group |

Club identity is the **name**: `team_id` is file-local, so `t001` is a different
club in every feed. Names are normalised for أ/إ/آ and Arabic-Indic digits before
matching, which correctly merges spellings like `إنبي` / `انبي`.

### What the source data cannot tell us

- **Only 50% of goals have a named scorer.** 1,680 completed matches record goals
  but no scorers. Standings are unaffected; top-scorer tables are incomplete.
- **No birth years at all.** Every imported player has an inferred one and
  `birth_year_verified = 0`. All 3,414 need review.
- **No goal minutes**, so `minute` is NULL on every imported goal.
- **No player identity.** A name is only unique within a team, so the same person
  at two clubs becomes two rows (462 names are shared across rows). Splitting is
  the recoverable error; merging without identity data is not.
- **Cards are effectively absent** — 2 in the whole feed.
- `"لا يوجد بيانات"` ("no data available") is written into scorer lists as if it
  were a name. It is filtered out; imported literally it was the leading scorer
  of the season with 63 goals.

### Source problems worth fixing upstream

The import warns about these rather than hiding them:

- **`match_id` is not unique within a file.** `m028` in c003/2009 names three
  different fixtures. The import keys on feed position instead, so nothing is
  lost — but anything looking a match up by id (including the current apps) will
  find the wrong one.
- **10 matches contradict themselves**, listing more scorers than the scoreline
  allows (e.g. c002/2009 `m098`: six scorers, `home_score` 0).
- **`home_squade`** is misspelled in 4,454 matches; `home_squad` in 105.

## Push notifications

When news or a venue is published, the backend broadcasts a push notification.
It uses **Firebase Cloud Messaging topics**: both clients subscribe to a topic
and the backend sends one message per event — no device tokens are stored.

### Dry-run (default)

With `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` unset, notifications run in **dry-run**: the exact
payload is logged and nothing is sent. So the pipeline works today —

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/news \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Admin-Key: dev-admin-key" \
  --data '{"title_ar":"عنوان الخبر","details_ar":"..."}'
# -> logs: [notifications:dry-run] topic=news title='عنوان الخبر' ...
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/admin/news` | `X-Admin-Key` | Create a news item; notify topic `news` (unless it's a draft) |
| POST | `/api/admin/venues` | `X-Admin-Key` | Create a venue; notify topic `venues` |
| POST | `/api/push/subscribe` | public | Web client posts its FCM token to join the topics |

`app/services/notifications.py` holds `notify_new_news()` / `notify_new_venue()`
— the same helpers a future admin panel calls, so the trigger lives in one place.
The JSON migration does **not** call them, so importing history stays silent.

### Going live

1. Create a Firebase project and enable Cloud Messaging.
2. Download a **service-account JSON** (Project settings → Service accounts) and
   point `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` at it. Real sending turns on automatically.
3. **Android app** (Flutter): add `firebase_core` + `firebase_messaging` and the
   `google-services.json`, then on startup
   `FirebaseMessaging.instance.subscribeToTopic('news')` and `'venues'`. Requires
   rebuilding and re-publishing the app.
4. **Web** (PWA): add the Firebase JS SDK + a `firebase-messaging-sw.js` service
   worker and a **VAPID** web-push key; request permission, get the token, and
   POST it to `/api/push/subscribe` (web has no client-side topic API, so the
   server subscribes the token via the Instance ID API).

Until steps 1–2 are done everything stays in dry-run; no client or server code
changes are needed to flip it on.
