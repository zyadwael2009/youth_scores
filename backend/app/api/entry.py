"""Match data entry for the admin panel (any signed-in admin).

Pick a competition, create/edit a match, set the score and status, and record
goals and cards. Scorers/carded players are resolved by name within the team —
an unknown name creates the player on the spot (the readme's "quick add"),
inheriting the age group's birth year, flagged unverified.

Standings need no explicit recompute: they are derived from match rows on read,
so saving a score updates every table that depends on it.
