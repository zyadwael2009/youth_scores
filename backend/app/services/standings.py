"""League table computation.

A port of the identical Dart and TypeScript implementations this replaces
(`lib/core/utils/standings_calculator.dart`, `web/src/lib/utils.ts`). The point
of moving it here is that the rule below now exists once instead of twice, so
the website and the app cannot drift apart on who finished top.

The tiebreak rule is deliberately unusual — see `break_tie`.
