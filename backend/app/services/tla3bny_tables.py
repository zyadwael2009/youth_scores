Reuses the youthscores standings engine (`services.standings`) unchanged — the
algorithm and its unusual head-to-head tiebreak are identical — passing tla3bny's
own match vocabulary (a result is "completed" or "finished"; knockouts are
"knockout"). Each (competition, age) pair is
the tla3bny equivalent of one youthscores competition instance, so stages and
